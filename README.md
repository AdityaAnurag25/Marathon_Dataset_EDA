# Marathon_Dataset_EDA
This repository contains a ipynb file in which Exploratory Data Analysis was done on a dataset of ultra marathon races which took place around the world in the past 2 centuries. The analysis aimed at analysing data pertaining to 50 mile and 50 kilometer marathons which took place in the United States of America in the year 2022.

The libraries used in this exploratory analysis are Pandas for data manipulation and analysis and Seaborn for data visualization.
The EDA consisted of multiple steps, namely, data extraction, data cleaning, data restructuring, data visualization and data analysis.

# Data Extraction
The dataset was extracted from the kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633) and stored in a dataframe. The dataset was first stored in a google drive folder and then was extracted into the jupyter notebook.

# Data Cleaning
In this step, the dataset was cleaned by first applying certain filters to obtain a dataframe containing only relevant data.

# Data Restructuring
In this step, the dataset was restructured. New columns were added according to the objective of the analysis as well as redundant columns were removed in order to decrease the size of the dataset on which the analysis was to be performed.

# Data Visualization
In this step, some graphs were obtained from the dataset using the 'seaborn' python library. 

# Data Analysis
In this step, certain questions pertaining to the dataset were answered using functions present in the pandas library.
